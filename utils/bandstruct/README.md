# `band_structure_plot` â€“ Band Structure Visualization Tool

## Overview

`band_structure_plot.py` is a Python script that provides a set of tools for processing `.eigen` files generated by [**SPARC**](https://github.com/SPARC-X/SPARC/) and visualizing the band structure of a given system.

## Requirements

To use `band_structure_plot.py`, you need the following:

- Python 3.6 or later
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

### Plotting Band Structure

You can use the `plot_band_structure` function to create visualizations of the band structure from your provided `.eigen` file.

### Reading Eigen Files

The `read_eigen_file` function is a separate utility that enables you to read and extract data from a `.eigen` file.

## Example

Explore an example of how to use `plot_band_structure` to visualize the band structure of a CdS system in the `example/` directory.
